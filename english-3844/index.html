										<h3>More about Writing and Digital Media</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This course is offered at Virginia Tech within the English Department.
									A lot of the focus in this class is about understanding your audience and paying attention to
								the difference in their perspective while promoting good writing skills. This class has helped
							me to experiment with different mediums of displaying media while understanding how each of them
						reshape our minds. </p>
						<p>An interesting aspect to connect Human Computer Interaction and Digital media is understanding how social media platforms are
						using human centric design. Social media platforms and games have been increasingly popular and the reason they are so fun, addictive, and compelling
					is because of their design cycle: collecting, points, feedback, exchanges, and customization. As more and more games and social media platforms come
				in the market, people become saturated and thus having a longer-term, life cycle perspective on game design as experience design is considered sustainable
			in the industry. Read more about it<a href="https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/march-april-2011/bridging-the-gaps-between-hci-and-social-media1"> here.</a></p>
